Worldclock
----------
Worldclock is a Sailfish application to display clocks of cities around the world, sortable on name and time. Clicking on a selected city will show more info (e.g. detailed daylight saving transition).

Worldclock is using QT 5.2 's new QTimeZone class.

The worlclock RPM can be downloaded from [openrepos.net](https://openrepos.net/content/ade/worldclock).
